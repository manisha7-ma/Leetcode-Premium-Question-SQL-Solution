Explanation: Only the customer_id with id 3 bought the product A and B but not the product C.


SOLUTION 
select a.customer_id , b.customer_name 
from 
(
select customer_id ,
COALESCE(sum(case when product_name='A'then 1 else 0 end ),0) as A,
COALESCE(sum(case when product_name='B'then 1 else 0 end ),0) as B,
COALESCE(sum(case when product_name='C'then 1 else 0 end ),0) as C 
from Orders
group by customer_id
) as a 
LEFT JOIN Customers as b 
on a.customer_id=b.customer_id
where a.A>=1 and a.B>=1 and a.C=0
order by customer_id
