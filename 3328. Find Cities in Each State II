Table: cities

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    | 
+-------------+---------+
| state       | varchar |
| city        | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
(state, city) is the combination of columns with unique values for this table.
Each row of this table contains the state name and the city name within that state.
Write a solution to find all the cities in each state and analyze them based on the following requirements:

Combine all cities into a comma-separated string for each state.
Only include states that have at least 3 cities.
Only include states where at least one city starts with the same letter as the state name.
Return the result table ordered by the count of matching-letter cities in descending order and then by state name in ascending order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example:

Input:

cities table:

+--------------+---------------+
| state        | city          |
+--------------+---------------+
| New York     | New York City |
| New York     | Newark        |
| New York     | Buffalo       |
| New York     | Rochester     |
| California   | San Francisco |
| California   | Sacramento    |
| California   | San Diego     |
| California   | Los Angeles   |
| Texas        | Tyler         |
| Texas        | Temple        |
| Texas        | Taylor        |
| Texas        | Dallas        |
| Pennsylvania | Philadelphia  |
| Pennsylvania | Pittsburgh    |
| Pennsylvania | Pottstown     |
+--------------+---------------+
Output:

+-------------+-------------------------------------------+-----------------------+
| state       | cities                                    | matching_letter_count |
+-------------+-------------------------------------------+-----------------------+
| Pennsylvania| Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Pottstown       | 3                     |
| Texas       | Dallas, Taylor, Temple, Tyler             | 3                     |
| New York    | Buffalo, Newark, New York City, Rochester | 2                     |
+-------------+-------------------------------------------+-----------------------+
Explanation:

Pennsylvania:
Has 3 cities (meets minimum requirement)
All 3 cities start with 'P' (same as state)
matching_letter_count = 3
Texas:
Has 4 cities (meets minimum requirement)
3 cities (Taylor, Temple, Tyler) start with 'T' (same as state)
matching_letter_count = 3
New York:
Has 4 cities (meets minimum requirement)
2 cities (Newark, New York City) start with 'N' (same as state)
matching_letter_count = 2
California is not included in the output because:
Although it has 4 cities (meets minimum requirement)
No cities start with 'C' (doesn't meet the matching letter requirement)
Note:

Results are ordered by matching_letter_count in descending order
When matching_letter_count is the same (Texas and New York both have 2), they are ordered by state name alphabetically
Cities in each row are ordered alphabetically

SOLUTION
select state , cities , matches as matching_letter_count from 
(
select state , count(*) as total , sum(case when matches=1 then 1 else 0 end) as matches ,
GROUP_CONCAT(city  order by city SEPARATOR ', ') as cities from
(
select *,case when substring(state,1,1)=substring(city,1,1) then 1 else 0 end as matches
from cities
)s
group by state
) d 
where total>=3 and matches>=1
order by matching_letter_count desc,state
