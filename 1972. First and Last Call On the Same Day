Table: Calls

+--------------+----------+
| Column Name  | Type     |
+--------------+----------+
| caller_id    | int      |
| recipient_id | int      |
| call_time    | datetime |
+--------------+----------+
(caller_id, recipient_id, call_time) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
Each row contains information about the time of a phone call between caller_id and recipient_id.
 

Write a solution to report the IDs of the users whose first and last calls on any day were with the same person. Calls are counted regardless of being the caller or the recipient.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Calls table:
+-----------+--------------+---------------------+
| caller_id | recipient_id | call_time           |
+-----------+--------------+---------------------+
| 8         | 4            | 2021-08-24 17:46:07 |
| 4         | 8            | 2021-08-24 19:57:13 |
| 5         | 1            | 2021-08-11 05:28:44 |
| 8         | 3            | 2021-08-17 04:04:15 |
| 11        | 3            | 2021-08-17 13:07:00 |
| 8         | 11           | 2021-08-17 22:22:22 |
+-----------+--------------+---------------------+
Output: 
+---------+
| user_id |
+---------+
| 1       |
| 4       |
| 5       |
| 8       |

Explanation: 
On 2021-08-24, the first and last call of this day for user 8 was with user 4. User 8 should be included in the answer.
Similarly, user 4 on 2021-08-24 had their first and last call with user 8. User 4 should be included in the answer.
On 2021-08-11, user 1 and 5 had a call. This call was the only call for both of them on this day. Since this call is the first and last call of the day for both of them, they should both be included in the answer.

SOLUTION 
Consider the Following Conditions Carefully 
1.The first and last call made by the user is on for the same user
2.The user called just one user but the second user called multiple people so there call count for the day =1 will also be considered

# Write your MySQL query statement below
with cte as(
select id ,DATE(call_time) as dates ,count(distinct recipient_id) as d,
MAX(CALL_TIME) AS ma,MIN(CALL_TIME) as mi from (
select caller_id as id,recipient_id,call_time 
from Calls
union all 
select recipient_id as id,caller_id,call_time 
from Calls
)s
group by id,dates
order  BY dates
)


select * from (
(
select distinct a.id as user_id from cte  as a join 
(
select dates,ma,mi
from cte
group by dates,ma,mi
having count(*)>=2
) as b
on a.dates=b.dates and a.ma=b.ma and a.mi=b.mi
)

union 
(
    select id from cte where d=1
)
) s
order by user_id
