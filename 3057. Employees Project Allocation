Table: Project

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| project_id  | int     |
| employee_id | int     |
| workload    | int     |
+-------------+---------+
employee_id is the primary key (column with unique values) of this table.
employee_id is a foreign key (reference column) to Employee table.
Each row of this table indicates that the employee with employee_id is working on the project with project_id and the workload of the project.
Table: Employees

+------------------+---------+
| Column Name      | Type    |
+------------------+---------+
| employee_id      | int     |
| name             | varchar |
| team             | varchar |
+------------------+---------+
employee_id is the primary key (column with unique values) of this table.
Each row of this table contains information about one employee.
Write a solution to find the employees who are allocated to projects with a workload that exceeds the average workload of all employees for their respective teams

Return the result table ordered by employee_id, project_id in ascending order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Project table:
+-------------+-------------+----------+
| project_id  | employee_id | workload |
+-------------+-------------+----------+
| 1           | 1           |  45      |
| 1           | 2           |  90      | 
| 2           | 3           |  12      |
| 2           | 4           |  68      |
+-------------+-------------+----------+
Employees table:
+-------------+--------+------+
| employee_id | name   | team |
+-------------+--------+------+
| 1           | Khaled | A    |
| 2           | Ali    | B    |
| 3           | John   | B    |
| 4           | Doe    | A    |
+-------------+--------+------+
Output: 
+-------------+------------+---------------+------------------+
| employee_id | project_id | employee_name | project_workload |
+-------------+------------+---------------+------------------+  
| 2           | 1          | Ali           | 90               | 
| 4           | 2          | Doe           | 68               | 
+-------------+------------+---------------+------------------+
Explanation: 
- Employee with ID 1 has a project workload of 45 and belongs to Team A, where the average workload is 56.50. Since his project workload does not exceed the team's average workload, he will be excluded.
- Employee with ID 2 has a project workload of 90 and belongs to Team B, where the average workload is 51.00. Since his project workload does exceed the team's average workload, he will be included.
- Employee with ID 3 has a project workload of 12 and belongs to Team B, where the average workload is 51.00. Since his project workload does not exceed the team's average workload, he will be excluded.
- Employee with ID 4 has a project workload of 68 and belongs to Team A, where the average workload is 56.50. Since his project workload does exceed the team's average workload, he will be included.
Result table orderd by employee_id, project_id in ascending order.

SOLUTION
# Write your MySQL query statement below
with cte as (
select a.*,b.name,b.team from
Project as a 
Left join 
Employees as b 
on 
a.employee_id=b.employee_id 
) ,
cte2 as (
select team,AVG(workload)  as a from
cte
group by team
)
select EMPLOYEE_ID , PROJECT_ID ,name as EMPLOYEE_NAME ,workload as PROJECT_WORKLOAD 
from 
cte left join 
cte2
on cte.team=cte2.team
where  workload>a
order by employee_id,project_id
