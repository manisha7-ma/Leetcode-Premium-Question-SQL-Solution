Table: Products

+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| product_id  | int  |
| price       | int  |
+-------------+------+
product_id contains unique values.
Each row in this table shows the ID of a product and the price of one unit.
 

Table: Purchases

+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| invoice_id  | int  |
| product_id  | int  |
| quantity    | int  |
+-------------+------+
(invoice_id, product_id) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
Each row in this table shows the quantity ordered from one product in an invoice. 
 

Write a solution to show the details of the invoice with the highest price. If two or more invoices have the same price, return the details of the one with the smallest invoice_id.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is shown in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Products table:
+------------+-------+
| product_id | price |
+------------+-------+
| 1          | 100   |
| 2          | 200   |
+------------+-------+
Purchases table:
+------------+------------+----------+
| invoice_id | product_id | quantity |
+------------+------------+----------+
| 1          | 1          | 2        |
| 3          | 2          | 1        |
| 2          | 2          | 3        |
| 2          | 1          | 4        |
| 4          | 1          | 10       |
+------------+------------+----------+
Output: 
+------------+----------+-------+
| product_id | quantity | price |
+------------+----------+-------+
| 2          | 3        | 600   |
| 1          | 4        | 400   |
+------------+----------+-------+
Explanation: 
Invoice 1: price = (2 * 100) = $200
Invoice 2: price = (4 * 100) + (3 * 200) = $1000
Invoice 3: price = (1 * 200) = $200
Invoice 4: price = (10 * 100) = $1000

The highest price is $1000, and the invoices with the highest prices are 2 and 4. We return the details of the one with the smallest ID, which is invoice 2.

SOLUTION

with cte as (
select a.* , a.quantity*b.price as price from 
Purchases as a 
LEFT JOIN 
Products as b
on a.product_id=b.product_id
) ,
cte2 as 
(
select invoice_id , SUM(price) as price from cte 
group by invoice_id
)
select product_id,quantity,price from cte
where 
invoice_id =(select invoice_id from cte2 where price =(select MAX(price) from cte2) order by invoice_id limit 1)
